        The text message came late Tuesday. Like others I’d been getting recently, it wasn’t an obvious scam from the outset — no promise of a warranty or that I’d won a prize, no link to a suspicious website — but instead it seemed to be a frantic message intended for someone else.
        
        It’s the kind of text message that has become common for just about anyone with a smartphone.
        
        “Una, good evening, tomorrow morning the contract time of 10am is shifted to 3pm for signing, I don’t feel well, I need to go to the hospital tomorrow morning to see the doctor”
        
        I responded that it was the wrong number. Of course, it didn’t end there. The person on the other end, “Anna,” struck up a conversation. 
        
        Within a few minutes, she was offering to help me invest in cryptocurrency.</p>
